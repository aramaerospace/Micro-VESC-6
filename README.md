# Micro-VESC-6
Micro VESC-6:  44mmx34mm PCB packs the VESC 6 with 6xPowerTDFN FETS. 3.3V regulator only.
Update: I have been working with VESC for the last few years and would love to revisit the Micro-VESC-6 design. The one which is published currently can be improved a lot, to say the least. 
I plan to publish much better version within the next 3-5 months. Thanks!
